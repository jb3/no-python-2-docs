# No Python 2 docs

Remove Python 2 documentation (jankily) from Google Search results.

It has been grinding my gears how many times I accidentally click on Python 2 docs so I built a plugin to obliterate it from the results page, simple as that.

## Usage

Clone the repository and unzip it to a folder, enable Developer mode in Chrome and import the unpacked folder  to add it to Chrome.
